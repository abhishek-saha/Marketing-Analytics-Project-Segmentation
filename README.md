# Marketing Analytics Project on Segmentation
-----------------------------------------------
## Introduction
#### Pernalonga is a supermarket chain which finds itself in a spot where it is reliant on promotions to drive sales, as over 30% of sales derive from promotions. Currently, the majority of the promotions at Pernalonga are in-store promotions. The problem associated with in-store promotions is that they offer temporary price reductions to customers regardless of their need. Hence, Pernalonga is losing part of its revenue by offering promotions to those who would be willing to purchase the items at full price. Because Pernalonga does not have a strong or thorough marketing campaign, they are leaving money on the table by not effectively targeting stores, customers, or products with their promotions. Thus, as the consulting team working with Pernalonga, we will help them better understand their customers and how to develop a strong marketing campaign that will boost revenue through the use of segmentation.
